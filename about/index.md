So this is just one page where I can write about myself, without feeling the need for it to be useful. And some day this site will be all that's left of me, so I might as well write my own mini autobiography. Actually, I don't even know myself clearly. Anyway, I'm trying.

## Me in 10 second ##
**I'm a** lifelong learner, INFP, explorer,morning person. **I love** trying new things, be creative and productive.

**Interest:** AI🤖️/Machine Learning🧠/Sports💪/Art🎨

**Idol:** Faye Wong/Yico Yseng🧸

**apps:** 豆瓣/小宇宙/bilibili/notion/youtube

**my mantra:** Stay hungry, Stay foolish.
